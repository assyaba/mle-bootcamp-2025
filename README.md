# MLE Bootcamp 2025

This repository documents my journey to becoming a Machine Learning and AI Engineer.  
Each week, I’ll add projects, notebooks, and notes as I progress through the roadmap.  

## Current Stage
- ✅ Week 1: Environment setup & Python refresh  
- ⏳ Week 2: Statistics and Linear Models  

## Structure
/week1/: foundational scripts

/week2/: notebooks on regression & metrics

/projects/: complete ML projects
