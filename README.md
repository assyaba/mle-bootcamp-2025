# MLE Bootcamp 2025

This repository documents my journey to becoming a Machine Learning and AI Engineer.  
Each week, I’ll add projects, notebooks, and notes as I progress through the roadmap.  

## Current Stage
- ✅ Week 1: Environment setup & Python refresh  
- ⏳ Week 2: Statistics and Linear Models  

## Structure
/week1/: foundational scripts

/week2/: notebooks on regression & metrics

/projects/: complete ML projects

## Goals (Week 1)
- [x] Setup & first commit
- [ ] Git workflow (branch → PR → merge)
- [ ] Python refresh exercises

## Repo Structure
- `week1/` — fundamentals (hello, small scripts)
- `projects/` — end-to-end ML/AI projects
- `docs/` — notes, diagrams

## Next Milestones
- Add Python refresh notebook
- Start Titanic mini-project (Week 2)
